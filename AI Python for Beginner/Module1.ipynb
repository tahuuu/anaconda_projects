He's past the chaotic, boundless energy of puppyhood and adolescence, but still possesses a good amount of stamina and enthusiasm for activities. He would probably enjoy regular walks, playtime with toys, and engaging in short bursts of spirited play. While he can sustain activity, he also appreciates downtime and comfortable naps, especially nestled close to his human companions due to his smaller size.\n",

He would likely enjoy his daily walks, sniffing out new scents, and engaging in games like fetch or tug-of-war. Food and treats would be a high motivator. He'd probably be very keen on spending time with his family, whether that's cuddling on the couch, following them around the house, or going on car rides. Due to his size, he might also have an interest in finding cozy napping spots, burrowing under blankets, or enjoying a good lap-sit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behaviorally, Otto would generally be confident, predictable, and well-established in his routines and understanding of household rules (assuming he’s been trained and socialized). He would likely be a loyal and affectionate companion, deeply bonded to his primary caregivers. He might exhibit protective behaviors towards his home or family, potentially being vocal (barking) at strangers or unusual sounds. His social skills with other dogs and people would be well-developed if he's had good exposure. He's less likely to engage in destructive chewing (unless bored or anxious) and more likely to seek out comfort and interaction. He would be an intelligent and responsive dog, capable of learning new tricks and commands, and enjoying mental stimulation as much as physical activity.\n"
